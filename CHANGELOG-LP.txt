- Removed stray '}' after <body> that was visible at top-left.
- Unified content width to 1280px max to match header rhythm.
- Hero min-height: 520 (desktop), 460 (laptop), 360 (mobile); bottom-aligned search.
- Search panel + partner pills aligned to header width; side padding 24px each side (48px total).
- Controls scaled to 42px height, 14.5px text, 12px labels; compact gaps (8px).
- Grid proportions: 1.35fr 1.35fr 1fr 1fr auto.
- Script includes now deterministic & deferred: /js/lib/autocomplete.js then /js/search-launch.js.
- No inline JS added; XSS posture intact.
